Some samples of code I wrote, below is a description of each folder.

<b>Contents</b>
<ul>

 <li>Reusable Text Blocks</li>
 <li>Social Media Content Factory</li>
 <li>VueJs</li>
 <li>Wordpress</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<b>Portfolio Site</b><br/>
<p>This is the underlying code for my own business card/portfolio site (markpruce.com). I hand coded this site from scratch, using html, css and javascript/jquery. It is simple, modern looking, responsive, and loads very fast.</p>

<b>ReactJs</b><br/>
<p>Here I have code samples from two different React web apps - I did not include all of the source code, instead I just picked out a few pages and components from each that I was the primary developer on.</p>

<b>Reusable Text Blocks</b><br/>
<p>
I took over work on a client's existing Wordpress site that was rather bloated with plugins. Among many others, the site was using a plugin called Reusable Text Blocks - a simple plugin allowing a user to make a 'text block' and display it in multiple places on the site via shortcode. The plugin also allows custom block templates to be built and I used this feature to build out some additional functionality on the site using the existing plugins.
</p>

<b>Social Media Content Factory</b><br/>
<p>
I've extracted the controller, view, css and js files for a particular feature called the Social Media Content Factory (and also a screenshot of the page). The purpose of the feature was to help administrators easily and quickly pull content submitted to different areas of a community-organizing website and share them across social media platforms. </p>

<b>VueJs</b><br/>
<p>Here I have a few code sample files from a Vue web app - I did not include all of the source code, only a few files that I worked on. My main role on this team was skinning the UI, so I did not build the JS from scratch but wrote all of the CSS and some of the JS in these files.</p>

<b>Wordpress</b><br/>
<p>I have included some files from a few different Wordpress sites - primarily these files are from child themes that I build for these clients - php, javascript and css. My most common WP workflow is to use a barebones theme and modify with a child theme, incorporating editable fields from Advanced Custom Fields Pro into custom page templates.</p>
